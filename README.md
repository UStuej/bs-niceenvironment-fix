# bs-niceenvironment-fix
Fixes the bug in Ikeiwa's EditSaber program in the NiceEnvironment where the top and bottom lasers are reversed in the actual Beat Saber game.

This program is meant to be used either if you want to convert the level from editable to playable, or vice-versa.

How to install:
  1. Place NiceEnvironmentFix.py in your Beat Saber folder.
  2. Install Python 3.4.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-344/

How to use:
  1. Double-click on NiceEnvironmentFix.py
  2. Enter the level folder's (the one that you want to fix) path when the program asks.
